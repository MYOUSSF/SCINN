# SCINN: Physics-Informed Machine Learning Library

**SCINN** is a Python library for physics-informed machine learning, designed to simplify and enhance the process of solving scientific machine learning problems.

SCINN is a fork of [DeepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde) library, but with fundamental changes and many improvements. It avoids the redundancies in the original library and adds new features to better support custom workflows.

> **Note:** SCINN is still under active development and is not yet functional.

## Key Features
- Simplified API for faster development.
- Support of more complex geoemtries
- Improved stability and performance for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).
- New functionalities for handling a wider range of physics-based problems.
